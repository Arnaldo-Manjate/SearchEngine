2. Go through each file and you will see my comments on what needs to be done
3. Indent the code, try indenting without a package it will help when going to certain lanuages like python ...
4. Remove bootstrap from this site you dont need it you just adding unnecessary resources on a small site
5. Build all styles with your own css (you can look at the bootstrap styling)
6. Add the admin side
   - You should be able to do a full CRUD process there
   - Your entry point should be searchengine/admin this searchengine is just a placeholder
   - Remember admin sections are well protected
